## Hi,
this is a brief intro about ~~Yoshikage Kira~~ me:
> My name is Harry Yang. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Los Altos, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the local department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

## Stats 🏆
I'm **Harry Yang**, a high school student at **Beijing National Day School**. I'm an ardent learner interested in new things and getting to know new people. As of grade 12, I'll have learned calculus I~III, probability theory, AP stats, AP chem, AP physics, AP bio, marine bio, AP lang, AP lit, AP psych, and sociology in class. I've got a satisfactory TOEFL score, a passable SAT score, and a decent GPA. I've been the president of the biology club *BioCamp* and the *iGEM* club as well as a member of the Origami club and financial mathematics club in our high school. I joined many academic competitions such as ARML, BBO, BMT, CTB, HiMCM, JL essay competition, and S.T. Yau science award. I'm applying for the 2025 round of top undergrads in 🇺🇸 😣

I don't give a SHIT about these stats. But, if they help you get to know me 😋😜

Three quirky things about me: .

## Aspirations

My motto (picked up from the *How to Train Your Dragon Series* by Cressida Cowell) is
> To become a hero the *hard* way.

Another slang I like is
> Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.

Fac et spera

anyways...
