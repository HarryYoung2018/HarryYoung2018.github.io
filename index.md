I'm Harry Yang, a high school student in the AP program at Beijing National Day School. I'm a multipotentialite who loves learning new things and getting to know new people. 

such as Machine Learning, Game Theory, Social Psychology, Synthetic Biology, Literature, and Sports. I'm working on many research projects.

This is a platform where I can reach out to more people who share my interests and passions, take useful advice from them, and keep track of important moments and ideas for future reference.

My motto (picked up from the *How to Train Your Dragon Series* by Cressida Cowell) is
> To become a hero the *hard* way.
Another slange I like is
> Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.
